# Migrations

Mouthful comes with a couple of handy migration tools. These allow for seemless data migration from other commenting engines into mouthful, or between the various mouthful data stores.

Currently supported tools:
* [Isso to moutful migration](./isso/README.md)
* [Mouthful sqlite to moutful dynamodb migration](./dynamodb/README.md)
